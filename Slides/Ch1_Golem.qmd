## Statistical models as golems

-  Powerful & unyielding
-  Follow instructions with single-minded purpose
-  Only "know" what they are told to do

::: {.fragment}
Cannot tell us what is "right", "True", or even "OK to say"

Let's not treat our Golems (statistics) as police

We must treat our Golems as tools

## Why can't golems _rule out_ or _falsify_ hypotheses?

1.  Hypotheses are not models (and as we will see, golems only know deal with models)

-  One hypothesis might be represented by many model**s**

_Hypothesis_: pathogen transmission is shaped by variability in susceptibility

_Models_: $\beta I^p S^q$, $ks \ln\left(1+\frac{\beta I}{k}\right)$, $\frac{\beta S I}{c+S+I}$, ...

## Why can't golems _rule out_ or _falsify_ hypotheses?

1.  Hypotheses are not models (and as we will see, golems only know deal with models)

-  One hypothesis might be represented by many model**s**
-  One model might be consistent with many hypothese**s**

_All of those models might come from heterogeneity in susceptibility, but also spatial or contact structure, etc._

## Why can't golems _rule out_ or _falsify_ hypotheses?

1.  Hypotheses are not models (and as we will see, golems only know deal with models)
2.  Measurements matter
-  Observation error: _uncertainty in what we observe, biases, measurement error_
-  Hypotheses are continuous: _X is more/less important, not simply T/F_

_How do we measure heterogeneity? How much counts as a lot?_

## Why can't golems _rule out_ or _falsify_ hypotheses?

1.  Hypotheses are not models (and as we will see, golems only know deal with models)
2.  Measurements matter
3.  We make inference about hypotheses as a group, by consensus

## What do you want from your statistics?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Understand **causation**?

-  Does $x \rightarrow y$?
-  Is $x_1$ more important than $x_2$?
-  What is the value of parameter $\beta$?
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Predict** likely outcomes?

-  Which model is better at predicting new observations?
-  What can we expect in a new time or place?
:::

::::

::: {.fragment .center}
_These are not the same_
:::

## Different goals require different approaches

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Understand **causation**?

-  Experiments
-  Directed acyclic graphs
-  Path analysis

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Predict** future outcomes?

-  Cross validation
-  Information criteria 
-  Sensitivity analysis
:::

::: {.fragment .center}
What is good for prediction _may not_ be good for understanding causation
:::

::: {.fragment .center}
But all of this requires statistical golems
